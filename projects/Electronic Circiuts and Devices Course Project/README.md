<h3>In this project we utilized our understanding gained from the course to design and simulate a circuit that uses bipolar junction transistors
(BJTs) to create a police siren light and dancing light (astable multivibrator) meeting a set of specifications. The frequency of the astable
multivibrator circuit (visualized by the rate of flickering of the LEDs) was also studied. </h3>
