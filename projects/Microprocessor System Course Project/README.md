<h3> In this project, we interfaced a 4x4 matrix keypad with the FRDM KL25Z microcontroller to develop a key-scanning program. The program is designed to recognize alphanumeric keys, display them on TeraTerm, and handle special characters (* and #) by waiting for numeric input and generating specified patterns accordingly.</h3>
