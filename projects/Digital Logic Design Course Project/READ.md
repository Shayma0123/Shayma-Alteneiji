<h3> In this project, we designed an elevator controller for a four-floor building using an FPGA, adhering to a set of specifications and design constraints. The report outlines the design methodology, finite state machine, and block diagram of the system, as well as the Verilog code and FPGA results, which demonstrate the system's functionality.  </h3>
