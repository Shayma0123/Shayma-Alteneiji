<h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineering student passionate about problem-solving, signal processing, and electromagntic theory. This page highlights my hands-on experience from university coursework, projects, and senior design work.</p>

<h4>Projects:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera & Radar Calibration:</strong> Intrinsic and extrinsic calibration for senior design project.</li>
  <li><strong>Sensor Fusion:</strong> MATLAB implementation of camera-radar data fusion for object tracking using EKF.</li>
  <li><strong>Kalman Filter Research:</strong> LS, RLS, and KF methods, including engineering decisions for synchronization, motion models, and pseudocode.</li>
  <li><strong>MATLAB Simulations:</strong> Analysis of Slotted and Pure ALOHA multiple access protocols.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Systems:</strong> System identification and performance analysis of compensated systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Undergraduate Research Course:</strong> Tasks implemented as part of a project on Passive Radar design.</li>
  <li><strong>Active Noise Cancellation:</strong> Work-in-progress real-time implementation for headphones.</li>
  <li>Various mini-assignments and hands-on experiments.</li>
</ul>
