<h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
<p>Iâ€™m an Electrical Engineering student with a passion for circuits, signal processing, and applied electromagnetics. I lead projects from theory to implementation, breaking complex problems into modules, guiding teams, and diving deep into research to fully understand systems before building them.</p>

<h4>Projects:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera & Radar Calibration:</strong> Thoertical study and Implmentation of Intrinsic and extrinsic calibration (senior design project).</li>
  <li><strong>Interfacing TI IWR 6843 to a Rassberry Pi:</strong> Thorugh procedure invlved and refrenced code (senior design project).</li>
  <li><strong>Sensor Fusion:</strong> MATLAB implementation of camera-radar data fusion for object tracking using EKF and GNN data association method (senior design project).</li>
  <li><strong>Kalman Filter Research:</strong> LS, RLS, and KF methods, including engineering decisions for synchronization, motion models, target tracking methods, and pseudocode (senior design project).</li>
  <li><strong>MATLAB Simulations:</strong> Throughput Analysis of Slotted and Pure ALOHA multiple access protocols with fixed and dynamic Retransmission probablity.</li>
  <li><strong>Control Systems:</strong> System identification and performance analysis of compensated systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Undergraduate Research Course:</strong> Tasks implemented as part of a project on designing a Pssive Radar System including theortical study, Derivations of related Eqs., and MATLAB simulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Active Noise Cancellation:</strong> Work-in-progress real-time implementation for headphones.</li>
  <li><strong>FPGA Project:</strong> Elevator controller for a four-floor using a finite state machine.</li>
  <li><strong>Electrical Machines:</strong> Implmented an experiment to synchronize a synchronous generator to a grid (load).</li> 
  <li><strong>Electronic Circiuts Design:</strong> Designed and simulated an astable multivibrator circuit using (BJTs) to implement a police siren light.</li>
  <li><strong> COMSOL Assignment:</strong> Simulated a simple electrode system and analyzing deign effects on Electric field and breakdown voltage.</li>
